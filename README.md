Task Description
Each level will have a different price variance and a different number of days. Using the provided data, you must buy silver once and sell silver once in order to achieve maximum profit. You always buy the same amount of silver, so the trick is to gain as much profit as possible for this static amount. You are not allowed to buy and sell on the same day. If you cannot achieve a profit - achieve a minimum loss.
